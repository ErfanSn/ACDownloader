## Requirements

- [python](https://www.python.org/)
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
- [kmplayer](https://www.kmplayer.com/)

## Initial setup

On Windows, download latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.2/python-3.9.2-amd64.exe) & [Ffmpeg](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-full.7z) & [KMPlayer](https://soft98.ir/multi-media/video-player/278-kmplayer-dl.html) and install Python and KMPlayer.

On Ubuntu, open your terminal by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+T` and install the FFmpeg & KMPlayer & Python package, by typing:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
sudo apt-get install python3.8
sudo apt-get install kmplayer
```

## How it works

If you are a Windows user, extract after downloading the code, then copy `ffmpeg.exe` to that folder, else this unnecessary.

In order to have a video version of the held class, you need to get the address of the desired class as follows:

Then open commands.text and insert command as following and pressing `Ctrl+s`:
```
echo class_link_1 > saved_file_name_1
echo class_link_2 > saved_file_name_2
...
```

Now hold `shift` and `right click` on the code folder and select Terminal or PowerShell and enter the following command:
```
python main.py
```

At the end, follow the instructions that you see inside Terminal or PowerShell.

## Output

If the master has used the `share screen` feature, the output will be a video file in `flv` format, otherwise an audio file will be saved in the `output` folder.

## Known issues

- ~If the teacher allows a student to speak, the sound will not be inserted into the output at the appropriate time~
